## What Is It?
- A stupid little project made because I miss playing foosball everyday at work... Enter names of players, select Tarantino Mode -- or don't, weirdo... then create teams. No more arguing over who is playing on what team and who is playing defense or attack... Jason - you are forced to play somthing other than defense!
